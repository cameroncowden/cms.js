Hello! This is the awesome about page! 

From user [Hedja](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Hedja), regarding web decentralization -

>It feels like this is already a work in progress using Beaker Browser and Dat.
>- Beaker lets you browse entire websites (dat archives) and fork them.
>
>- It lets you create and serve your own sites directly from the browser and seed it from a server (like a torrent).
>
>- It lets other sites create templated sites under your name for user generated content.
>
>- Visitors by default temporarily seed your website which may reduce single point of failures, hug of deaths and costs.
>
>With this peer-to-peer torrent-like approach, the web can become distributed again and feel more like a "web". There's still a lot of work left 
>and maybe Beaker itself isn't the best implementation for this idea, but it's a good start.
