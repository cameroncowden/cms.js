Sample post two! Success!

Rejoice ye peoples, for ye can now blog easily like in Jekyll but for p2p, but without the need to touch the command line to create new blog posts or regenerate the site locally!

Simply fork this site, and create new posts by adding files in the posts folder! 

Follow the naming convention - date, post title, dot md! (that's for Markdown!, see example post for usage examples)
